# Overview

Enhanced version of the standard demo counter app example with:
- [network requests](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/networking/fetch-data)
- [item list rendering](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/lists/mixed-list)
- [tab navigator](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/tabs)

# How to run

1. Install [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install). You can verify your installation with:
```
flutter --version
```
2. Check your available tools and platforms, install or repair the missing if needed:
```
flutter doctor
```
Note that additional tools are required for specific platforms:
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) for Android development (see guides for [Windows](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows#android-setup)/[Linux](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/linux#android-setup))
- [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) for iOS development (see the guide for [macOS](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos#ios-setup))
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) for Windows desktop development (see [Flutter's additional Windows requirements](https://docs.flutter.dev/desktop#additional-windows-requirements))
- [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and optionally [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) (for plugin support) for macOS desktop development (see [Flutter's additional macOS requirements](https://docs.flutter.dev/desktop#additional-macos-requirements))
- additional libraries for Linux desktop development (see [Flutter's additional Linux requirements](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/linux#additional-linux-requirements))
- Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Edge for web development (Chrome and Edge fully support the debug mode, see [Flutter's Web FAQ](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/web/faq#which-web-browsers-are-supported-by-flutter))
3. Run the application from the project root directory:
```
flutter run
```
Select the desired platform to run the application.

For mobile development, the emulator needs to be already running to be detected.

Application debuggers will be accessible under URLs displayed in the terminal.
